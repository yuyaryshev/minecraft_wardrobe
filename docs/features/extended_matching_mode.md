Extended matching mode

Shift-clicking on a bound item should allow changing match mode:
- Normal - one that is implemented now already, displays no symbol
- By tag - displays small '#' on left button in inventory cell in Setup mode only and when hovering mouse displays tag name. User can continue to shift-click - this way cycling through all tags related to this item.
- By type - for non-stackable item - like any pickaxe, any axe, any sword, etc - should be displayed by small 'T' on left button in inventory cell.

In these modes items should first try to refill with original item and only if that item is not available - try matching by tag or by type. When selecting non original item by type - try picking up one with max durability stat.
