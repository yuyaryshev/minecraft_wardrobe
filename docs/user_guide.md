Welcome to your Wardrobe!
To use Wardrobe place a chest(or other inventory) under it and some more chests on side and behind it. Chest below Wardrobe is used for unloading into it. Chests to the side and back are used to load (refill) items.

In wardrobe UI you can preset which items to load and which to unload from/to your character to do it switch to "Setup" mode.
- Loading - left-click on an item you are holding in your inventory to make it load to your character - this is shown as green border.
- Unloading - use right-click to set unloading of an item slot.
- Complex mode - you can fine tune loading if you, say, want to have at least 10 cobblestone and at most 20 - click on right bottom quarter to set min=10 and on top right quarter to set max = 20.
- When in "Setup" some items might get in the way of your setup - switch rapidly to "Operational" - there you can move your items, then switch back.

After you done "Setup" - switch to "Operational" mode.
Here you can just "Transfer all" items with one hit of a button.
Or you can Transfer just one item - Shift + click on that slot.
Or you can manually move items as in normal inventory.

Settings:
- Settings button is under the "Setup/Operational" switch.
- Fast transfer setting is per-player (None / Right click / Shift-click).
- "How to?" is inside Settings.

Color borders show mode of each cell.
Color background show operation which will happen on "Transfer".
- Green - loading/refill
- Yellow - also loading/refill but you don't have enough items in chests around Wardrobe to fulfill your demands
- Red - unloading
